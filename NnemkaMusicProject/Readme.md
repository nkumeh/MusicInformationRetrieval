# Music Backend Services Project

### Overview
This project aims to build a suite of backend services tailored for the music industry, focusing on a music catalog system, playlist scheduler, live music chat, and scalable microservices architecture. This project is designed as a month-long journey to demonstrate and refine backend engineering skills, with a special focus on technologies relevant to the music industry.

### Features
##### Music Catalog RESTful API: 
Manage songs, artists, and albums with user authentication and authorization.
Playlist Scheduler & Live Chat: Automated playlist scheduling and real-time chat for music events.
Microservices for Music Streaming: Separate services for user management, music streaming, and chat.
Scalable & Distributed Systems: Utilize Apache Kafka and Docker for handling high volumes of data and user activity.
CDN Integration: Set up a Content Delivery Network for efficient music file delivery.
Caching & Database Optimization: Implement caching and optimize database for performance.
Technologies Used
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB Atlas
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Real-Time Communication: WebSockets with Socket.io
Job Queue: Bull for task scheduling
Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes
Caching: Redis
CDN: Cloudflare
Testing: Jest, Mocha, Postman
Documentation: Swagger
